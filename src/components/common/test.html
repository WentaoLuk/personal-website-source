    <p>Hi! Finally! I (almost--) finished building my blog.</p>
    <p>This may not be a real blog, since the website is build on GitHub, and GitHub is only to host static pages. But I
        am still feeling good because it is the first website I
        built for myself. Now let's take a look on what I have done on this project.
    </p>
    <p>
        First of all, the website is built by ReactJS. THe landing page is a template provided by Jacobo Mart√≠nez on
        Gatsby. So I pulled the whole template from his github. It did saved
        me a lot of initial work. (Big thanks for this wonderful template! I linked his GitHub page down in the footer
        of this website.)
    </p>
    <p>
        The blog is built on React. Since I cannot deploy the backend on GitHub Pages, everything has to be static. So
        all this words you are reading, all the tags are all
        put inside as arrays in a 'warehouse', which is the mock.js. Thus you will notice that when you click on any of
        the articles,
        the page will not be refreshed. Everything here is JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
        The blog pages is devided into 3 sections, each of them is displayed as grid. You might have noticed that the
        second section is the
        aggregation of the first and third
        section, but displayed in a different way.
        I also put a paginate function, down below, but since I currently do not have a lot of articles, I decided to
        save it for later use.
    </p>
    <p>
        The popup window is build as a component, and hided by default until you click any of the articles. Then it will
        pass
        the title, tags, and the cotend as an array right into the Popup component to be displayed, then the window pops
        up.
    </p>
    <p>
        That's how I built my blog. Hope you enjoy browsing my blog.
    </p>
